Dataset:
Used the LeapGestRecog dataset from Kaggle, which contains thousands of images of various hand gestures.

Preprocessing:
Images were resized to 150x150 pixels and normalized.
Applied data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip to enhance the training data diversity.

Model Architecture:
Built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with layers for feature extraction and classification.
The model includes multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling, a flatten layer, and dense layers with dropout for regularization.

Training:
Trained the model on the preprocessed images using the training and validation sets.
Monitored the model's performance and adjusted the training process to prevent overfitting.

Evaluation:
Achieved impressive accuracy in recognizing and classifying hand gestures.
Evaluated the model using validation data to ensure robustness and reliability.

This project demonstrates the capability of deep learning to create responsive and interactive systems. By accurately recognizing hand gestures, this model opens up new possibilities for more natural and intuitive ways to interact with technology.
